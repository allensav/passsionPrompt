    <p> I am pretty passionate about health and wellness overall. 
        Staying physically active, eating healthy, taking time for self care , the whole 9 yards! 
        It’s something that I feel has been more valued as of lately - but I think self care starts with putting you 
        and your needs first. That’s the best way you can pour into others, when you’re glass is full. I’m sure we can all 
        agree when we feel energized, well rested, mentally engaged, etc., we perform our best. One of the coolest things a
        bout self care is it can mean different things for everyone- taking time daily to do something physically active 
        outside, personal maintenance/grooming, meditating, cooking or doing another  activity you enjoy- the list goes on. </p>

    <p> I think I was first really introduced to self care when I got out of college. Between still being in COVID, 
        running a marketing business, working my first real 9-5, and just adulting as a whole- I had dealt with burnout before 
        and I was determined to find ways to combat it. There were often times I felt like I “didn’t have time for 
        self care”- the classic answer I’m sure we’ve all heard or used before. But i learned that self care doesn’t 
        have to mean taking a 2 hour long bubble bath every single night, sometimes it’s taking 10 minutes out of your day
        to enter a quiet room, reset, and collect your thoughts to keep yourself on track. Sometimes it’s scheduling 
        personal time in a busy week to journal or meal prepping to save time and energy.

        In the beginning - I was use to being in environments where you work work work until the day’s tasks are done! 
        <a href=”https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself”> This article </a>
        showcases a few reasons why that actually isn't the best idea. 
        My biggest inspiration was probably burn out haha- knowing that I have big goals for myself and what burn out 
        lead to for my momentum and health, i knew it was something I needed to avoid. I leaned on my peers, mentors, 
        and even my own intuition to inspire me to know what works best.

    </p>

   <p> 
    I really want to provide tools/resources to kids in minority communities to help them be on the same, if not more 
    advanced, learning path as their peers in other communities.  I feel like getting a head start on resources whether 
    they be financial or knowledge/education is important towards reaching your goals, or at least knowing they’re 
    attainable. So for me , continuing to advocate for self care is about being the best version of you so you can 
    accomplish big things!
